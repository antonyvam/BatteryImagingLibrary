## TODO:

-   keyword filters - also allow keyword search? appears below search bar and can be deleted by clicking/have delete button on them
    -   necessitates search with multiple queries - should be simple adjustment
-   (accordioned?) table of contents - floating left on computer, between folds on mobile
    -   on hover over category (lab, xrd etc), expand
-
-   cleanup jsx: add comments, deduplicate
-   plot optix script for processing real volumes
-   add (relative) volume path to csv s.t in csv_to_json we can also call processing code (i.e csv_to_json gens everything you need)
