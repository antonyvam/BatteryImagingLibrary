# Battery Imaging Library

**BIL** is the first multi-modal multi-length scale battery imaging database.

It currently includes the following type of data:

- Synchrotron 3D S3DXRD along with raw 2D diffraction patterns for one 2D cross section
- 2D EBSD data along with raw Kikuchi diffraction pattern and corresponding 2D FIB SEM/EDX data
- 3D FIB SEM with corresponding EDX data
- Synchrotron X-ray nano-CT
- Synchrotron X-ray micro-CT including two dynamic 4D experiments
- Synchrotron XRD-CT including datasets at different states of charge of the same battery
- Neutron-CT
- Laboratory X-ray micro-ct

ðŸ“˜ Official website: https://www.batteryimaginglibrary.com

The laboratory X-ray micro-ct cover the most widely used battery chemistries as shown in the following figure, specifically primary alkaline and LiFeS2 as well as rechargable NiMH and Li-ion. The sample cover a wide range of battery sizes, from the the world's smallest cylindrical Li-ion battery (Panasonic pintype) to a large 4680 Li-ion battery.

Importantly, BIL contains raw data for all techniques, including raw radiographs / sinograms, X-ray and electron diffraction patterns as illustrated in the following figure.

BIL contains data also from dynamic X-ray micro-ct with primary batteries (see gifs below) as well as XRD-CT data from dynamic experiments with Li-ion batteries [1, 2].

## Included Tutorials

The repository includes several **example notebooks** to help users learn the API and workflows:


| Notebook Filename | Topic |
|------------------|--------|
| [`neutron_ct.ipynb`](https://github.com/antonyvam/BatteryImagingLibrary/blob/master/notebooks/neutron_ct.ipynb) | Reconstructing neutron-ct data from raw radiographs |


Each notebook is designed to be **standalone and executable**, with detailed inline comments and example outputs.

## Installation Instructions

The `BIL` notebooks depend on three main libraries: `ImageD11`, `CIL` and `nDTomo`. `ImageD11` is used to handle the S3DXRD data, `CIL` is used for the reconstruction of the laboratory cone beam CT data and `nDTomo` is used for the data handling of the XRD-CT, neutron-CT and parallel-beam CT and SEM/EDX/EBSD data.


To make your life easier, please install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). The `ImageD11`, `CIL` and `nDTomo` libraries and all associated code can be installed by following the next steps:

### 1. Install CIL with TIGRE and astra-toolbox

Create a new environment and first install astra-toolbox:

```bash
conda create --name bil python=3.11
conda activate bil
conda install -c astra-toolbox -c nvidia -c conda-forge -c https://software.repos.intel.com/python/conda -c ccpi astra-toolbox cil ti
```

### 2. Install nDTomo from GitHub

You can choose one of the following options to install the nDTomo library:

#### a. To install using pip:

```bash
pip install nDTomo
```

#### b. To install using Git:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/antonyvam/nDTomo.git
```
For development work (editable install):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/antonyvam/nDTomo.git && cd nDTomo
pip install -e .
```

#### c. For local installation after downloading the repo:

Navigate to where the `setup.py` file is located and run:

```bash
pip install --user .
```

or:

```bash
python3 setup.py install --user
```

### 3. Install PyTorch

The neural networks, as well as any GPU-based code, used in `nDTomo` require Pytorch which can be installed through pip.

For example, for Windows/Linux with CUDA 11.8:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

## 4. Install ImageD11

`ImageD11` can be installed through pip:

```bash
pip install ImageD11
```

Please visit ImageD11's github repo for alternative installation instructions  https://github.com/FABLE-3DXRD/ImageD11/tree/master
