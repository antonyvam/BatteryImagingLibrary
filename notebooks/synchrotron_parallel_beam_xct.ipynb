    "# Synchrotron Parallel-Beam X-ray CT\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to process and reconstruct parallel-beam tomography data acquired at a synchrotron beamline. Unlike laboratory cone-beam systems, synchrotron setups typically provide a highly collimated parallel beam, enabling more straightforward reconstruction workflows and often higher-quality results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Setup and Imports\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by importing the required libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Core Python tools**:  \n",
    "  - `h5py`, `os`, and `time` for data handling and file I/O.  \n",
    "  - `numpy` for numerical operations.  \n",
    "  - `matplotlib` for plotting.  \n",
    "  - `tqdm` for progress bars.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **nDTomo modules**:  \n",
    "  - `astra_rec_single`, `astra_rec_vol` for tomographic reconstruction using ASTRA.  \n",
    "  - `sinocentering`, `scalesinos` for sinogram alignment and scaling.  \n",
    "  - `cirmask` for applying circular masks to reconstructed slices or volumes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Algotom**:  \n",
    "  - `remove_stripe_based_sorting` for ring artefact reduction in sinograms.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We also enable `%matplotlib qt` to allow interactive plotting in separate windows.  \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Before reconstruction, we need to correct the raw projections using dark and flat fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cropping:**  \n",
    "   Offsets are applied in the x and y directions (`xofs`, `yofs`) to select the central region of the detector. A vertical slice (`ystart:yend`) is chosen to limit the field of view to the relevant part of the sample.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dark field:**  \n",
    "   Computed as the mean of the first 50 frames, where the beam is off. This captures detector background noise.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Flat field:**  \n",
    "   Computed as the mean of frames 50–100, where the beam is on but no sample is present. This provides the illumination profile.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Radiograph:**  \n",
    "   A single projection (frame 1050) is corrected using the formula:  \n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   I_{\\text{corr}} = \\frac{I_{\\text{raw}} - D}{F - D}\n",
    "   $$\n",

    "   where \\(D\\) is the dark field and \\(F\\) the flat field. Negative values are set to zero.\n",

    "   - A cropped raw projection for context.  \n",
    "   - The dark and flat fields separately.  \n",
    "   - A corrected radiograph to confirm successful normalisation.  \n",
    "   - A horizontal detector line across multiple projections for quick inspection of intensity variation.  \n",
    "\n",

    "Dark/flat correction ensures that detector artefacts and beam inhomogeneities are removed, so that the reconstructed volume reflects only sample absorption and not experimental artefacts."
