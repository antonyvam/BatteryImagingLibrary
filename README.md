## Old:

-   form to submit data:
    -   DOI required
    -   sends email to us
    -   allows them to add optional metadata fields determined by us
-   make another sheet on battery ct and add in your headers
-   button to show all scans @ top
-   thumbnail orthoslices in scan previews
-   a scan name in the csv and in the scan table
-   range sliders for relevant filter criteria - show N results - maybe floating in LHS
-   plot optix script for processing real volumes
-   matplotlib script for plotting (paired) line scan and 2D slice rendering for XCT
-   multi orthoslices need to go: instead should be a shared video component (two videos, rendered horiz on cpu. vert on mobile with one slider that controls both)
-   add (relative) volume path to csv s.t in csv_to_json we can also call processing code (i.e csv_to_json gens everything you need)
-   cleanup jsx: add comments, deduplicate
